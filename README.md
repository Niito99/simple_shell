# Simple Shell

## Description:
This repository contains a minimalist implementation of a Unix-like shell in C, designed for educational purposes and as a starting point for understanding the fundamentals of shell programming. The shell supports basic command execution, simple piping, and has a straightforward interactive mode.

## Features:

-Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.

-The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.

-The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.

-The command lines are made only of one word. No arguments will be passed to programs.

-If an executable cannot be found, print an error message and display the prompt again.

-Handle errors.

-You have to handle the “end of file” condition (Ctrl+D).


## Usage:
To use the simple shell, clone the repository and compile the code using a C compiler. Run the executable to launch the shell.
